# dots
heres a quick installation guide
you will need grim(screenshots), sway(wm), waybar for bar, azote for backgrounds and wofi for launcher looks a bit ugly 
because of my gtk theme but works, zsh for shell and kitty for terminal
you will also need jet brains mono for fonts and i love that font.

thats all the dependencies i think and can remember of, now just clone the repo in home folder or something
